# wdi39-project-1



Initial Thoughts - all written before the project.
My initial plan is to create the game 'BattleShips' as my first project. I think it will be a challenge for me, and some aspects of the game immediately have forced me to think how I will approach them. Setting up the grid and styling the page is not too much of a concern, so I will keep the styling basic to begin with while I solve the following problems that worry me the most:

  1. <h5>Ship placement at the beginning of the game.</h5>
  What I'm writing here now I hope will make myself laugh in a few days time. Initial thoughts are that this is going to be a very difficult task, with numerous ways to approach it. Whether I automatically select a ship and have the user manipulate it before confirming it's final position, or I enable to user to click and drag the ship... I'm accepting that a lot of my time could be invested into solving this particular riddle.

  2. Logic of CPU shots
  This seems simple to begin with, as I can run code for the CPU to target any random available square. However, once there is a hit I need the computer to be smart about where it fires next. Immediate thought is that a square that contains ship is a separate class and that if that class is selected, then the next shot is +1 square up down east or west to it. But once the CPU has two hits in a row, they must then choose the next square in the line, as a human player would.

These two points are what has my brain ticking over the most at the moment, but I'm sure more puzzles will present themselves as we go along. When creating a very basic layout to work with I'm going to make sure I add extra buttons that I can later replace with images or other styling, just so that I can give them commands to test specific aspects of the game as I progress.

Stage one is to write out the timeline of the game in plain english, and then in suedo code. Following this I can put together the basic style of the page once I know how and which elements I will need to build and manipulate...!!
